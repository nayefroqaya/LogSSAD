LogSSAD: Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection in Log Series

## üìå Description
**LogSSAD** is a novel approach for log-based anomaly detection, i.e., textual event series.
Main steps:

(1) Leverage a diverse set of features.

(2) Using only normal data, we apply OC-SVM to generate pseudo-labels and estimate labels for unlabeled log sequences in the training set.

(3) Employ an ensemble learning framework to train the dataset.

We conducted empirical evaluations on two open-source datasets, HDFS and BGL, and achieved the following results:

LogSSAD attains the #highest F1 score on the HDFS dataset and a #competitive F1 score on the BGL dataset. Additionally, it demonstrates efficient runtime performance during both training and testing, achieving the #shortest runtime compared to baseline methods on both GPU and CPU.

## üìä Datasets
We used two open-source log datasets (more will be added in the future):

| Software System | Description                          | Time Span  | # Messages   | Data Size | Link |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|------------|--------------|-----------|------|
| **HDFS**        | Hadoop Distributed File System log   | 38.7 hours | 11,175,629   | 1.47 GB   | [LogHub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub) |
| **BGL**         | Blue Gene/L supercomputer log        | 214.7 days | 4,747,963    | 708.76 MB | [LogHub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub)  |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment
All libraries are specified with their versions in the requirements file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Preparation
Steps to run LogSSAD:

1. Create a dataset directory under `datasets` (e.g., `HDFS`, `BGL`).
2. In main.py file, make the name of the dataset BGL or HDFS.
3. Be sure you install all libraries in requirement file.

## üìå Data Parsing
1. For Drain parser details, see [IBM Drain](https://github.com/logpai/logparser/tree/main/logparser/Drain).
2. The parsing code is available in our repository at drain_parser folder.
3. To start the parsing process, specify the dataset name in demo.py (i.e BGL) and run the file 'drain_parser/demo.py'.
4. The parsing output will be generated and saved in the datasets directory.

## üö® Anomaly Detection 
To apply LogSSAD on log data:
* Specify the dataset name in src/main.py (i.e BGL or HDFS)
* Run the main function (src/main.py).
* The main function will execute all stages: data preprocessing, anomaly detection, and evaluation.
